Sooo... I'm a nail polish addict. I made a database to keep track of it, and since I want to learn about data-handling thingies in various contexts it seems sensible to use this big ol' pile of silly data to do so. I made a simple desktop management tool, but really I'd like a web app and possibly mobile apps to talk to the same stuff, bunged on Azure or something. Time will tell. One repo, several projects cos they are all tiny (and also that's how I'm used to working, I'm a svn refugee...)
